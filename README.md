# Enhancing-Building-Object-Detection-in-Satellite-Imagery-through-Sentinel-2-Image-Preprocessing
  This research work builds upon the foundation laid by a tutorial provided by the Climate AI training tutorial, which serves as a valuable resource for advancing the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques into climate and disaster risk assessment. Flood disasters are a growing concern worldwide, demanding effective risk assessment and mitigation strategies. </br>
  This research employs advanced PyTorch neural networks in conjunction with high-resolution satellite imagery to identify and assess regions at risk of flood disasters. An integral part of this study involves the identification of building labels through satellite imagery analysis, facilitated by the robust capabilities of PyTorch's deep learning framework. The objective is to comprehend the potential impact of flood disasters on human settlements by understanding the spatial distribution of buildings within vulnerable regions. In addition to building labels, key predictors such as altitude, slope, land use, and rainfall are considered to provide a comprehensive understanding of flood vulnerability. By integrating these factors, this research aims to pinpoint particularly vulnerable regions, enabling informed decision-making for disaster preparedness and response.

### Risk assessment of Flood in coastal regions
- Flood vulnerability is a complex interplay of geographical and meteorological factors, compounded by the presence and distribution of human infrastructure. Leveraging cutting-edge technology like PyTorch neural networks and satellite imagery, this research seeks to holistically assess the risk of flood disasters. The `identification of building labels` within satellite imagery adds a critical dimension to this assessment, as the proximity of buildings to flood-prone areas can significantly influence disaster outcomes. By examining primary predictors such as altitude, slope, land use, and rainfall, this study offers a multifaceted view of vulnerability. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary approach contributes to the development of vulnerability maps that highlight high-risk areas, providing valuable insights for policymakers, emergency responders, and urban planners to enhance flood resilience in vulnerable regions.
- The results of this research demonstrate the potential of deep learning and PyTorch neural networks in improving the accuracy and efficiency of risk assessment in vulnerable regions. The automated identification of building labels combined with a robust set of predictors enhances the ability to predict and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. This work has significant implications for disaster management, urban planning, and policy development, ultimately contributing to the resilience and safety of vulnerable communities.

## Data Exploration and Preparation for Geospatial Analysis of Coastal Regions: Building Density with PyTorch and Buteo package
  **PyTorch** is highlighted as the primary framework for this geospatial analysis. It is described as a powerful tool that supports data preprocessing, custom neural network architectures, data augmentation, and GPU acceleration for efficient training. Additionally, custom loss functions, optimization algorithms, and evaluation metrics can be implemented. PyTorch can be seamlessly integrated with geospatial libraries like GDAL and rasterio for data handling, and models trained using PyTorch can be deployed in various ways.</br>
  `Data transformation` is a crucial step, involving the conversion of tif data into numpy arrays and preparing tabular data for input. The key library for data transformation and manipulation in this project is **buteo**, which can handle geospatial data reading, writing, processing, label creation from vector data, and patch generation from geospatial data. Other supporting packages mentioned include matplotlib and numpy.
